### Lesson2 - Create files, display contents and stats

During Lesson1,you have learned how to create directories.

Lets learn to create a new file, 

    touch file1.txt


and press enter key and read on :)




----

title: touch

touch command will create a new file or 
change time stamp of an existing file.
Now try again,

	touch  file1.txt

this time it will change file1.txt created/last access 
and modified time to current time.

	touch file2.txt

will create an empty new file ,if the file is not already exists.
to view directory contents ,you can also use

        dir
title: dir


`dir` is used to list directory contents.Yeah,as you guessed
it correctly , `dir` is equivalent to `ls -C -b` (I know you didn't
guess that :P)

that is, by default files are listed in columns, sorted vertically,
and special characters are represented by backslash escape sequences.
To clear a screen,the command is

	clear

title: clear

Viola! terminal screen is cleared!!!
Lets print some message on the terminal,

	echo "hello" 
title: echo

Cool! the message is displayed on the screen.
Lets redirect the message to a new file instead 
of screen.

	echo "hello" > hello.txt 

To append  data you must use &gt;&gt; not just &gt;

	echo "linux" >> hello.txt 
	echo "world" >> hello.txt

Done.To view the file content ,do 

	cat hello.txt 

title: cat

so now you have viewed the file content.`cat` is 
used to display the entire file content.<br/>


To view only first two lines from the file

	head -2 hello.txt



title: head

see,it showed us first two lines from files.
By default,`head` will display the first 10 lines when you run,

	head hello.txt 

Now how to view last two lines?.Its simple,use `tail`

	tail -2 hello.txt


title: tail

cool. Thus `head` will be used to display
lines from begining and `tail` will be 
used to display last few lines. As with `head` 

	tail hello.txt

by default will display last 10 lines from the file.

Lets check some stats of the files and directories
we have create so far.

	stat hello.txt

title: stat

carefully examine few important fields the output. The first line
shows the `filename`.second line says its a `regular file` with
size as `18`.Third  line shows `Inode` number and no.of `links`
to that inode.

Fourth one,says `owner(Uid),group(Gid)` who has read-write permission
but other have read permission.Final three lines show `access,modified 
and change` time.They mean:

	access - when the file was last accessed/read.
	modified - when the contents was last 
		 modified written.
	change - denotes changes to files metadata
		like changing user permission.


Now lets do a `stat` on directory.

	stat dir1

Compare the previous `stat` "hello.txt" output with "dir1",before you move.
especially find out "dir1" type.That marks the end of lesson2!.Well done.

Now  move to lesson3.
