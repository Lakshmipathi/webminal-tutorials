title: A Quick mysql tutorial in 7394 hours!

(This tutorial stolen from Online Linux Terminal 'www.webminal.org' - 
So better open your terminal and read on!)


So you are one of those tranditional/rigid user who  believe 
in SQL and arguing/fighting against NOSQL?

Welcome to a Quick mysql tutorial in 7394 hours!! 
(if you don't know mysql and computer and english.)

yeah, recenly conducted bogus scientific research results show 
that you'll need approx.7394 hours to complete this tutorial 
especially if you don't have any clue about what's mysql and 
computer and english!


Lets login to mysql client(use your loginname and database below),

        mysql -u yourname -p yourdatabase

Now press Enter key then provide password and see what happens



title: mysql

Did it say?

*`Welcome to the MySQL monitor`*
and more info like mysql version and others?

Now you are logged into interactive mysql prompt.

Lets first create a database: but wait, before that if you don't know what's a
database. Assume database as directory or folder where you store critical 
information in a specific format.
you can simply use 

        create database universe;

will create it.(you can't run create database
command, since we already created one just for 
you!..ok..ok..stop clapping your Hands)

Now inorder to use that database; type 

        use yourdatabasename;



title: use

Did it say?

*`Database changed`*

great!.You are ready to record some
data into this database.

To store information,you must provide
a name and format.This is known as 
table. To create a table named 'planets'
type,

		create table planets(name varchar(15), 
		  position int, has_moon boolean);

Press enter key it should display 
*`Query OK, 0 rows affected `*

title: create

Congrats! you successfully created table
with format.

To see list of tables available on this
database type 

        	show tables;

title: show

Wait a second, let me guess .hmm..

*thinking*

It should have displayed something like 


		+-------------------+
		| Tables_in_universe|
		+-------------------+
		| planets           |
		+-------------------+

right?,yes I know I know , I have IQ 180!
(+ or - 170 :P)

to view the format/structure of this
table.do  type,

        describe planets;



title: describe

Did you see the following?

		+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		| Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
		+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		| name     | varchar(15) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		| position | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		| has_moon | tinyint(1)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
		+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
		3 rows in set

This is what we used in create table command 
right?If you find anything missing report a 
bug to mysql community :P

So we created a 'directory/folder' (read as  database)
and 'filename' (read as table) with specfic
'extention' (read as format).Now its time
to 'write' (read as insert) some 'data' (read as record).

Lets first add our home (earth).We know its 
at third position from sun and has a moon.

        insert into planets values ('earth',3,1);




title: insert

Now lets add our possible future home,

        insert into planets values ('mars',4,2);

mars has 2 moons ! Just take a break, imagine
how is it to live in a place with two moons!  :)

yes,that would be cool ;)

okay,now we wrote two records into the table.

To retrieve these data from table,type

        select * from planets;

title: select

it shows

		+-------+----------+----------+
		| name  | position | has_moon |
		+-------+----------+----------+
		| earth |        3 |        1 |
		| mars  |        4 |        2 |
		+-------+----------+----------+
great!
(still dreaming about 2 moons sight? get
back to earth!)

Lets assume,you retrieve only those
record which has only one moon.For this
just append where condition to above
select query.

        select * from planets where has_moon=1;
		
we can modify the above query a little bit more,
we know we are selecting records with has_moon=1,
so ignore that field. show the rest of columns.

        select name,position from planets 
          where has_moon=1;

See - Its simple!. Now do 

        update planet;

title: update 

that should have displayed some error message.

Because you (yes,its you not my fault :P) didn't 
tell 'what' column to update and 'where' to 
update.

OMG,we entered some wrong data for earth,It appears recently
it  moved to 2 place in our solar system! need proof? go 
outside at 13:00.So we need to edit that record. How to do 
that? Here comes 'update' to your rescue.

        update planets set position=2 
	  where name="earth";

Now go and view results again via select query.
Now its time to trash something.Lets delete mars!

Say good bye to "Spirit".We going to destory it.

        delete * from planets where name="mars";

title: delete 

RIP Spirit (2003-2013)
